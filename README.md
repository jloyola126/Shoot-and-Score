# Shoot-and-Score
Simple Shoot-and-Score JavaScript Game

Programmer: Jonathan Loyola

A simple shoot and score game based off the famous Donkey Kong Country 1 King K Rool
Boss fight. When you are able to click the cannonball 20 times, the pattern changes and
the cannonball's speed also increases reflecting that of the actual boss fight. This concept
is still in-progress and very early on in it's development. Added patterns and bonuses will
be implmented in the future as well as a different arena.

There are only two patterns as of now.
